Q. How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

A. The best way to write programs that meet this criteria is to write code following best industry practices. This means commenting the code so that anyone viewing it can read and understand what is being done, as well as to use an apporpirate naming convention. The program should be organized and follow a logical pattern. The CRUD modeul for example was commented throughout the code, and each function was named after what the purpose was (create, read, update, delete). This makes it easier for anyone trying to make use of this code to quickly and easily understand how to do so. The CRUD module that was created is very flexible, and could be used to add new entries and update existing entries from the perspective of the shelters. As well as to remove entries after an animal is no longer available. 


Q. How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

A. As a computer scientist, the approach I used was to determine the requirements as well as have an understanding of the reason for the requirements. This can allow for a better realization of a project and improve the user experience. In this particular project, it was my first look at working with the front end of the project that users interact with. This made it more important to ensure that they were able to get the appropriate information in an easily understandable manner. In future projects I would try to work in more options for filtering data, making it easier to be flexible in searching for specifics. 


Q. What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

A. A computer scientist uses data science and other principles to create and improve computer systems. For these types of projects, it can be very beneficial to assist a company with making the best use of data they have available. In this project, they had a huge set of data that would theoretically be constantly changing. The best way for them to achieve their goals was to help them filter and sort through the data to find what they're looking for. We can build systems to allow for shelter workers to quickly and easily upload new dog profiles, and allow trainers to customize their filtering options to better find what they are looking for.
